# COMPRESSIVE-STRENGTH-OF-CONCRETE-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a
nonlinear function of the concrete age and some constituents. These constituents include cement, blast
furnace slag, fly ash, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. The concrete is the only
constituents that can be delivered to the working site in the plasticity form. This feature turns it into a notable
construction material because it can be cast in any form. We are going to analyze here using ANN . The ANN
usually, are used in the classification of a bunch of data.

# **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of 1030 instances with 9 attributes and has no missing values. There are 8 input
variables and 1 output variable. Seven input variables represent the amount of raw material (measured in
kg/m3) and one represents Age (in Days). The target variable is Concrete Compressive Strength measured in
(MPa â€” Mega Pascal). We shall explore the data to see how input features are affecting compressive
strength.
